#PROJECT NAME

- CookBook Recipe App

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- This Project is inteded for school purposes only.
- I made a simple version of Recipe Book. This App contains few cuisines from different countries. Each country has available decent amount of recipes. You can print the recipe if you wish using the "print" button and has an option to add it to your grocery list using the "add item" button. Once added to your grocery list, you can add new items in it using the input field. This also allows you to put a "check mark" if the list has been done and deletes an item if needed. A print option is also provided for this page if you wish to print a copy of your grocery list. You can leave a "like" or "unlike" if you feel like it.

#CHALLENGES and FEATURES

- I encountered few challenges while doing this project. The biggest one was handling route errors. I tried few different methods but some of them are either deprecated or not available for functional approach. There's few more features that i'd love to add to this App but I don't have the luxury of time.
