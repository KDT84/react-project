#PROJECT NAME

- Recipe App

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- This Project is inteded for school purposes only.
- I made a very simple version of a Cook Book. This App contains few recipes from different countries. To look for a certain recipe, you can either use the search button or click the following categories provided. 

For the search button you need to enter the name of the recipe that you wish to access correctly which then navigates you to the recipe page. Say for instance you typed the name incorrectly; this button wouldn’t work and instead displays a red border of the search field to let you know that the name you entered is either incorrect or not found. I also made the search option case insensitive so you can either type it in small letters or capital letters either way works.

 If you don’t want to use the search button you can just click either of the links provided. Each link contains few recipes. Once you click a category this would then navigate you to the another page where you can see few more recipes that you may like. To get to the recipe page you just click the recipe button provided. In the recipe page I’ve added two features where you can print the recipe and adds the ingredients into your grocery list. In the grocery list page you can add some more items if you wish or delete an item if not needed. You can also use the checkbox field once you’re done. Also I’ve added a print button in case you wish to have a copy of it. 

If you want to print another recipe you have click the home button and start all over again.

#CHALLENGES and FEATURES

- I encountered few challenges while doing this project. The biggest one was handling route errors. I tried few different methods but some of them are either deprecated or not available for functional approach. There's few more features that i'd love to add to this App but I don't have the luxury of time.
