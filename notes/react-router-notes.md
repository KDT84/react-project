```
The first thing we’ll need to do is to wrap our <App> component in a <Router> component (provided by React Router). Since we’re building a browser-based application, we can use two types of router from the React Router API:

BrowserRouter
HashRouter
The primary difference between them is evident in the URLs they create:

// <BrowserRouter>
http://example.com/about

// <HashRouter>
http://example.com/#/about
```
